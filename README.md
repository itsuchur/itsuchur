`<think>`Okay, I must come out with a decent README.md for my Github page. Let me think about this. First, I must include as much icons of programming languages and databases as possible even if i know only how to print 'hello world' on them or perform "select * from table". 

Wait does it mean my shitty page with nothing to showcase will load two Cenozoic eras on client side? Since its shitty practice, probably not necessary here-- it belongs to production code, after all.

I should check if there are other decent examples of repositories with README.md. Maybe "### Hi there ðŸ‘‹"? but that's too common. Maybe include stats, graphs and radar charts to overwhelm the visitor with ultimately useless, yet flashy, information and make them feel humbled?

Let me organize these thoughts. Start with the most common, then include the more unexpected outputs. Make sure the result is clear and concise. Avoid overcomplicating. The user might not be a Charles Babbage and my own skills aren't insane either. So, simple and short README.md would work well.

Ok, that...`</think>`

This is my README.md
