`<think>`Okay, I must come up with a decent README.md for my Github page. Let me think about this. First, I must include as many icons of programming languages and databases as possible, even if I only know how to print `hello, world` in them or perform `select * from table'`.

Wait, does it mean my empty page with nothing to showcase will take two Cenozoic eras to load on the client side? Since it's a bad practice, it's probably not necessary here-- it belongs to production code, after all.

I should check if there are other decent examples of repositories with README.md. Maybe `### Hi there ðŸ‘‹`? But that's too common. Maybe I should include stats, graphs, and radar charts to overwhelm visitors with ultimately useless, yet flashy, information and make them feel humbled?

Let me organize these thoughts. Start with the most common elements, then include the more unexpected outputs. Make sure the result is clear and concise. Avoid overcomplicating. The user might not be Charles Babbage, and my own skills aren't insane either. So, a simple and short README.md would work well.

Ok, that...`</think>`

This is my README.md
